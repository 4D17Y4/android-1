# Chromecast styled receiver support files

URL for hosting the main css and images: `https://rawgit.com/amahi/android/master/cast/style.css`

We had to change from raw.githubusercontent because it sent response with content-type as `text/plain`, however we required it as `text/css` for Chromecast to accept the CSS properly.
